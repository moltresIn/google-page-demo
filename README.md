## Introduction
The **Google Page Demo** project is a simple web application that replicates the basic functionality and layout of the Google search page. This project is created for educational purposes, showcasing how to build a responsive and functional search page using HTML and CSS.

## Features
- **Search Bar**: A functional search input field that captures user input.
- **Search Button**: A button to trigger the search action.
- **I'm Feeling Lucky Button**: A button that mimics the "I'm Feeling Lucky" feature of Google.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the page looks good on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
